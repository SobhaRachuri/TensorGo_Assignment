This Project is a Speech-to-Speech Chatbot that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to create a Natural, Interactive Experience.
The system captures User Speech, Processes it through GPT-2 to Generate a Response, and converts the Response back to Speech. It also features a live WebCam feed to Enhance User Engagement and has interactive GUI integrated with Tkinter.
